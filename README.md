# Sanity Studio + React Router with Visual Editing

This is the simplest version of querying [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io) content into a [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) application with [Visual Editing](https://www.sanity.io/docs/visual-editing) and interactive live preview inside Sanity Studio using [Presentation](https://www.sanity.io/docs/presentation).

[See the companion Guide](https://www.sanity.io/docs/visual-editing-with-remix-and-sanity-studio) for a step-by-step walkthrough of this setup.
