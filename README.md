This is the simplest version of querying and live previewing Sanity data from within a Remix website. [Updated to use preview-kit v2](https://github.com/sanity-io/preview-kit/blob/main/MIGRATION.md).

[See the companion Blog article](https://sanity.io/guides/remix-run-live-preview) for a step-by-step walkthrough of this setup.
